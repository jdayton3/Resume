Here are some of my current interests:

* [Blogging](https://jdayton3.github.io/myblog/) and learning the technologies associated with Jekyll
* Studying persuasive writing and rhetoric
* Automating my life with Python and Bash (for example, I recently wrote a script that emails me when my stocks rise or fall a certain amount)
* Listening to [podcasts](https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/) and [audiobooks](http://gladwell.com/david-and-goliath/)
* Long walks on the beach
