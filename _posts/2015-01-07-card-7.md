I volunteered as an [LDS Missionary](https://www.lds.org/callings/missionary/) for two years.  I maintained a rigorous 6 &frac12; days a week, 14 hours a day schedule, finding and teaching anyone interested in our message and conducting meetings with other missionaries.  I served in leadership positions over 8-32 other missionaries for over half of my mission.
